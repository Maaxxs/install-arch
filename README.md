# install-arch

these 3 scripts help me to get a very fast and clean installation of arch with xfce4.

create your partitions and download the first script ("1-setup.sh") 

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maaxxs/install-arch/master/1-setup.sh

EDIT this script and run it. it will automatically download the other 2 scripts. Be sure to edit the other scripts as well and to execute them as root.

# Install Arch

These 3 scripts help me to get a very fast and clean installation of arch with xfce4.

Create your partitions and download the first script ("1-setup.sh") with wget:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maaxxs/install-arch/master/1-setup.sh
```

**EDIT** this script and run it. It will automatically download the other 2 scripts. Make sure to edit the other scripts as well.
